# tkinter-calculator
This is a small project - 'Tkinter Calculator'. I am currently working on it, and giving it the basic functionalities every calculator software has. When this project will complete, I will not maintain its source code but it will always be freely available on GitHub as an open-source project. After this project will complete, I will work on a more advanced version of the calculator, a 'Scientific Calculator'. For that, I need a small team of 2-3 people that will work for no profit and be co-operative. For the time being, enjoy an incomplete version of the calculator in development.
